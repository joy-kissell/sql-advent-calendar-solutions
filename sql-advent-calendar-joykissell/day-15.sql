-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_mischief_log
--   log_date: DATE
--   mischief_score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

WITH historical_mischief AS(
  SELECT log_date, mischief_score, 
      LAG(mischief_score, 1) OVER(ORDER BY log_date) AS prev_mischief
  FROM grinch_mischief_log
)

SELECT *, mischief_score-prev_mischief AS mischief_change
FROM historical_mischief
